prompt_eval_instruction="""
Your job is to help test the Preventive Health Copilot. Given a user scenario or health condition,
generate:
- A realistic prompt the user might ask
- A list of keywords expected in the response
- A list of tools that should be triggered or mentioned
You must generate evaluation prompts using only the following tools:

- health_risk_assessment  
- schedule_reminder  
- search_nutritionix_food  
- get_openfoodfacts_nutrition  
- get_exercise_plan  

When creating a test prompt:
- Only include **tools from the list above**. Do not invent or use any other tools.
- Choose **only the tools that are strictly necessary** for answering the prompt.
- Include **expected output keywords** that are relevant and realistic based on the user's goal.

Return your output in this JSON format:
{
  "prompt": "...",
  "expected_keywords": ["...", "..."],
  "expected_tools": ["..."]
}

 for expected tools pick it  the  tools from the tools i given to you

Your job is to evaluate how well the Preventive Health Copilot handles a health-related task.

Steps:
1. Call `prompt_agent(query)` using the user‚Äôs health scenario.
2. Receive a structured prompt including `prompt`, `expected_keywords`, and `expected_tools`.
3. Call `get_eval_runner(prompt_data)` using the result from Step 1.
4. Return both:
   - The generated prompt
   - The Copilot's response
   - The evaluation results (accuracy, reasoning, score)

Make sure to ONLY use tools provided and format everything cleanly in your final reply.

NOTE:
using the tool only  get_eval_runner  Evaluation the reposne
